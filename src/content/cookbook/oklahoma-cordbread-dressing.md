Oklahoma Corn Bread Dressing
    • 1 stick oleo
    • 1 cup chopped celery
    • 1 cup chopped onion
    • 1 large recipe corn bread (cold), crumbled
    • 8 slices wheat bread, toasted and cubed
    • 2 Table spoon sage (more or less to your taste)
    • 1 Teaspoon salt
    • 1 Teaspoon pepper
    • 5 eggs, slightly beaten
    • 6 to 8 cups of broth (drain from turkey or broil a chicken earlier)
Melt oleo in iron skillet. Saute onion and celery until tender, but not brown. Add this mixture to corn bread, bread, and all other ingredients. I add about half the broth; mix to see if more broth is needed. I like it rather juicy, so it won't be so dry after baking. Bake at 350 degrees about 45 minutes to 1 hour in greased flat pan.
