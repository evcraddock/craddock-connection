Mississippi Mud Cake
    • 2 sticks melted margarine
    • 1 1/2 cup flour
    • 2 cups of sugar
    • 4 eggs
    • 1 teaspoon of vanilla
    • 4 ounces of coconut
    • 1 1/4 cups of pecans
    • 2 tablespoons of cocoa
icing:
    • 1 large jar of marshmallow cream
    • 1 pound of confectioners sugar
    • 1/3 cup of cocoa
    • 1/2 cup of melted margarine
    • 1 teaspoon of vanilla
    • 
To make the cake, stir together sugar, cocoa, and flour. Add eggs, margarine, coconut, pecans, and vanilla. Pour into a greased and floured 9X13 inch pan. (Use flour sparingly in pan or substitute sprinkle of cocoa) Bake at 350 degrees until done. Do not overcook - cake will be moist like brownies. Cool completely. Spread marshmallow cream on cake.

Mix the rest of the icing ingredients and spread over marshmallow cream. You may use half of the pecans for cake and the rest in icing if preferred.
