IN MEMORIUM

Laura J. Carby was born in Grayson county Kentucky, Sept 12, 1843; was married to David W. Craddock Dec. 12, 1867, to which union there were born five boys and three girls, of whom three are still living; John W. Craddock living seven miles north of town, Alonzo Craddock of Tulsa and Mrs J.A. Galloway of Los Angeles, Calif.

Together with her husband and family she came to Oklahoma in 1893, and to Caddo Co., in 1902. She with her husband moved to Verden where she lived until her death which occured Sept 14, her husband having departed this life in 1913.

It was just before the awakening of another day, just as the hour had reached three o'clock Thursday morning September 14, she went to sleep like a tired child. So peaceful were the last hours that the patient watchers hardly realized the end had came. After a long, busy and useful life she died as she had lived - honored, trusted and loved. She reared her own monument while she lived, in the hearts of all who knew her. Her life was completed, if work all done and well done constitute completion. Her Christian life was beautiful from its beginning to the close, and through all the viscissitudes and sorrows that are met in life, her faith in God never wavered. But she has left us and today the autumn leaves fall upon another grave that hides from our sight, all this mortal of a true and noble woman. It was here that the last and best days of her life were spent and when her last hour came and the God of eternity called her to her everlasting rest, it was her desire that beside her departed companion in our silent city on its sloping hillside, surrounded by the beauty, happiness and contentment of our people, where the flowers are sweetest and the birds warble their most melodious songs, should be the eternal resting place of all that was mortal of her.

Funeral services were held Friday afternoon, at the Methodist church. Rev. Chas. Mann officiating. The floral offerings were many and very beautiful. The pallbearers were chosen from members of the IOOF in honor of her departed husband who was a member of that lodge.

CARD OF THANKS

Words cannot express our appreciation of those friends who have shared with us the lonely vigils by the bedside of our loved one. No sweeter memories can live in any heart than the memory of their untiring devotion to the one who has just left us. The waves of sorrow break upon every shore, and we can but hope that friends as true may gather around each one of them should sorrow invade their homes.
