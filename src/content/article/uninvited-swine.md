The things that I know about my Grandpa Alonzo Craddock are little stories handed down  by my Dad and Aunt Fay. He died four years before I was born.

Dad once told me that the neighbors pig repeatedly came over uninvited and helped himself to their cornfield. After this happened several times and after asking the neighbor to keep the pig home, Dad and Grandpa just went pig hunting and shot the pig. You donâ€™t let perfectly good pork go to waste so they also butchered it.  There was a drawback, my Grandmother Ada refused to cook or eat any of the meat. So Grandpa and Dad had to do their own cooking when they wanted any of that pork.
