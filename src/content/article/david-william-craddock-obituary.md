DAVID W. CRADDOCK

Death again invaded our midst this week and summoned our citizen, David W. Craddock to the Great Beyond. He died at his home Sunday afternoon, April 27, at 3 o'clock, after an illness of several months, of cancer of the liver, aged 69 years.

David W. Craddock was born in Hart county, Kentucky, in 1844. He served in the Union army during the civil war and enlisted in Company A, 37th Kentucky Infantry in 1862, and later he was transferred to Company I, 30th Kentucky Calvary where he served to the close of the war.

In 1867 he was married to Miss Laura J. Carby in Grayson county, Ky. To this Union eight children were born, four of whom, together with his wife still survive him, two boys John and Lon, and two daughters, Mrs. Uriah Freed and Mrs. Lizzie Gallaway. Five brothers and two sisters are still living. Two sisters, Mrs. Mattie Hawkins and Mrs. Belle Graston are both residing in Grayson county, Kentucky; four brothers are living in Hart county, Kentucky and one brother George Craddock, is in Caddo, Oklahoma.

In 1888 he removed to Kansas, and lived in that state until 1897, when they came to Oklahoma and located in Lincoln county. In 1908 he came to Verden where he made his home until the time of his death. In the spring of 1911 he was elected marshal of the town of Verden, which position he held for five months, giving his best efforts to the work.

David W. Craddock was a man of strong convictions, a firm advocate and worker for the ideals of his faith in all phases of life, religious and social; always contending for the abolition of wrong; a lover of the young and weak, a kind and affectionate husband and father, and a citizen of sterling worth, in whose untimely death this community lost a worker whose demise is felt with keen sorrow in the homes of this neighborhood.

The funeral was held at the residence Monday afternoon, Rev. P. F. Harman of the Baptist church delivering the sermon and the remains were laid to rest in the Verden cemetery by the I. O. O. F. lodge of Verden of which order he has been a member for many years.

The News joins in extending sympathy to the widow and family in their sad bereavement.
