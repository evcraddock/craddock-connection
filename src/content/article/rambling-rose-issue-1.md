Several years back some of the sister-in-laws, cousins and nieces began meeting and having a day out each month. This lasted for over a year and we had many good times and went to a lot of our local towns nearby and just enjoyed each other's company. We just sort of fizzled out as we got busy in our own immediate families. We said we would start up again in a few months. Well it turns out to be a few years but here we are. The Ramblin' Roses!

I hosted the first meeting. We all met at Samie's home. Larry was sick in bed but we made him get up anyway to take our picture.

From there we headed east to Chickasha all comfortably seated in Samie's van. Debbie was our driver (bless her heart). We enjoyed laughing and griping, but just a bit of that and we headed straight for Western Sizzlin' where we feasted lavishly. I know everyone went back to the buffet at least once.

After gorging for awhile we converged on downtown. Debbie, Betty, and B.J. went to the bookstore while Sue, Samie, Heidi and moi headed across the street to the antique store. After a bit of shopping we loaded up and headed back to Samie's.
More laughter and chatter and deciding that Samie would host next month's meeting. Perhaps she will come up with something more exciting. We hope those who couldn't come this month will be there.
