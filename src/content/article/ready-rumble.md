On Saturday night all of you that live in Oklahoma or the surrounding states are in for a great experience. Devin Jay Craddock will be participating in a cage fight at the Sugar Creek Casino on January 8, 2011 at 8 pm. The casino is located in Hinton, Ok which is about 30 minutes west of Oklahoma City, Ok right off of I-40.

This will be Devin's first sanctioned fight but he has fought several matches at the gym. According to Devin the hardest part of any fight is walking up the steps to the cage but "Once you get to the cage entrance, you run in and everything goes so fast that you don't have time to be nervous". I'm sure Devin has nothing to worry about, he has been in training for quite some time with Luke Davidson and Jarod Coleman who are more than just trainers but also his best friends. Devin trains everyday by running 4 miles in the mornings, followed by lifting weights for a couple of hours at the gym. Next the real work begins when he arrives at the training gym to work on grappling and kickboxing.

Devin is prepared to make his mark on the world and we are all excited to experience his first fight with him. Please be sure to head over to Hinton to see the match, it will be a great time and will mean alot to Devin and all of us. You won't be sorry or as Devin would say "One day life is gonna flash before your eyes. Make sure its worth watching." This fight will definitely be worth watching.
