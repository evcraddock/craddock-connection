My son is sick of the past or what he calls "old stuff". I turn on the history channel and his eyes roll. No matter how much talking I do about how awesome those Mayans were to be able to read the stars and build pyramids, he is just plain uninterested. This holds true for family history stories as well. I was sure that learning his great great great grandfather was a marshal and showing him a picture of me in his jail cell would interest him, but his response was a less than excited "cool". It seems with him the more recent the event the more interested he is. Stories about his Papa Larry got a chuckle but the next thing he said was something to the effect of "What did you do when you were a boy dad?". I had never really considered that anyone might care about the little events that had happened in my life. Seems like the only ones that might be interested in those stories would be my grandchildren. Come to think of it, I wish my grandparents had thought of this. I have always been more focused on hearing others' stories. I imagine most of us are.

With a little contemplation I can see how this attitude is a recipe for ignorance. Who to better tell my story than me? Fifty years from now when my grandchildren ask about me will anyone remember that I spent two years of my life living in the middle of the Panamanian jungle? Or that I once set foot on five continents in one twenty four hour period? It only makes sense, heck I'm interested in the fact that my great grandfather crossed a river in a buggy and built a house that still stands, events that I'm sure he himself would have found mundane. If not for those like Aunt Fay who had a knack for turning any event into a lively story, I might know even less.

The moral to this story is that when it comes to loved ones, no detail is too mundane. To search into our pasts is to get a glimpse of what potential we might have for our futures. Courage, compassion, intelligence, a sense of adventure, musically inclined, witty, determined and many other qualities come to mind when I think about the deeds of my ancestors. I have the same blood running through my veins and am capable of all these things and more.

I challenge all of you to send me a short story about yourself. One that you think your children or grandchildren should know. I've talked to a lot of people now about this and mostly what I hear is that they are unable to write things down well or that they don't tell stories very well. That is perfectly fine. Contact me at connection@craddock.org and I will help get your story written down.
