Times were hard as I grew up and the stories that the present day kids don’t want to hear about walking miles to  school and such were true, you older folks know this.  From the house where many of my brothers and I were born, my brothers Reginald, Lonnie, Onis and Paul, walked several miles to a little country school called Fariview.  My mom would cry  during the bitter cold winter months as they set out early in the mornings to get to school on time. She knew they would be so cold before they arrived at the not so warm and cozy school house.  A kind hearted neighbor lady living somewhere along the way would often watch for them and have them come inside to warm up and have a quick cup of warm cocoa.  I escaped this hardship as we moved to the Verden area before I became of school age and I was able to ride the bus to school.

When Leonard became old enough, he drove the bus to Verden School leaving from our yard,  but the other brothers couldn’t go there because it was not in our school district even though it was just across the road.  This was especially hard for  mom  since Leonard shared the other side of our house and she could see no good reason why the school would not let the boys go there. I imagine Leonard was not happy with it either but he could do nothing about it either.  Mom had many disputes with the school board over this but they were adamant in their position then.  This was probably a big reason that we moved from that location .   The opposite picture of the school was taken before my brothers went there. Sue Ann and I think we know some of them. If anyone can identify others or think we are wrong let us know and we’ll edit.

Each year it becomes harder to remember our loved ones that have passed on. Pictures help but what really does it for me are the little stories passed down from those who were there. I remember fondly my great Aunt Fay Finley who was my grandfather Van's sister. My grandfather passed before I was born but Aunt Fay always had a ready supply of stories to tell me about him.
